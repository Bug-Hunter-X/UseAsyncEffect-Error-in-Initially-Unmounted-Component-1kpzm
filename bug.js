This error occurs when using the Expo `useAsyncEffect` hook inside a component that is not rendered initially. The problem arises because `useAsyncEffect` attempts to perform its asynchronous operation before the component has fully mounted and received its props. In such cases, the asynchronous operation might not complete successfully or it might result in an error when accessing undefined props.
